Each of the following directories is explained below. Please also refer to the `Assignment.md` from Prof. Hocky's instructions. 

# Part 1
Check `Part1_test-psikit.ipynb` for all training steps.

I deleted some unnecessary files like `psi.3156234.clean` when uploading.

All the results are stored in `/Part1_Results`.
After the `Rendering Molecular Orbitals` section, Prof. Hocky mentioned I could ignore the PyMOL-related parts.

# Part 2
Check `Part2_Analysis.ipynb`.

All the results are stored in `/Part2_Results`.

I completed the BONUS task on labeling the structure of the molecule with the RESP charges.

# Part 3
Check `Part3_energy_table.ipynb`.

The main results/energy table is located within the Jupyter Notebook, and all other supplementary results are organized in `/Part3_Other_Results`.

I ignored all the Results directory when uploading.
