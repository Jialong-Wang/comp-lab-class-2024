# 1V1D_AMBER Project

Each of the following directories is explained below. Please also refer to the `Assignment.md` from Prof. Hocky's instructions:

- `1_1V1D_AMBER_INPUT` (will not be uploaded to GITHUB): Input scripts like `run_setup.sbatch` inside `1V1D_AMBER_INPUT` are copied to `1d_1V1D_AMBER_SETUP_GITHUB_UPLOADED_PURPOSE` for clarity.
  
- `1b_1V1D_AMBER_ANALYSIS`: For Step 9 (concatenate the trajectories, wrap the protein, and remove the solvent) and Step 10 (analysis of end-to-end distance and radius of gyration vs. time). Check the `README.md` inside for details.

- `1c_1V1D_AMBER_FIGURES`: Contains Step 10 analysis figures.

- `1d_1V1D_AMBER_SETUP_GITHUB_UPLOADED_PURPOSE`: Contains sbatch scripts for running MD, `.mdp` files for MD results, and `.gro` files for analysis.

# IONSINWATER Project

- `2_IONSINWATER_INPUT` (will not be uploaded to GITHUB): Input scripts like `run_setup.sbatch` inside `2_IONSINWATER_INPUT` are copied to `2d_IONSINWATER_SETUP_GITHUB_UPLOADED_PURPOSE` for clarity.

- `2b_IONSINWATER_ANALYSIS`: For Step 6 (unwrap the trajectory) and Steps 7 and 8 (calculate the mean squared displacement (MSD) and plot). Check the `README.md` inside for details.

- `2c_IONSINWATER_FIGURES`: Contains Step 8 analysis figures.

- `2d_IONSINWATER_SETUP_GITHUB_UPLOADED_PURPOSE`: Sbatch scripts and input files for setting up the Ions in Water simulation.
