# Figures Directory

This directory contains images and plots generated from the analysis steps performed during the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.

## Analysis Before Step 9

For analysis performed before Step 9, refer to the following Jupyter notebook:

- `Analysis_Before_Step9_JWANG.ipynb` inside `\Analysis`

## Final Analysis (Step 9)

For the final analysis and plots related to Step 9, refer to the following Jupyter notebook:

- `Analysis_Final_Step9_JWANG.ipynb` inside `\Analysis`

## Contents of the Figures Directory

This directory contains the figures generated from the two Jupyter notebooks mentioned above. 

Additionally, you will find a rendered image of the protein without solvent, created using VMD (Visual Molecular Dynamics).` Protein_No_Water.png` is the screenshot I took.

## Below are the Notes for reminding myself ONLY

First load the `.gro` file (`md_10ns.gro`) inside `../Data/md_10ns_output`, the load the trajectory file (`md_10ns.xtc`) inside `../Data/md_10ns_output`.

And it looks good?
